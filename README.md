Reactivity-Based RNA Profiling (RBRP) pipeline is built based on icSHAPE pipeline that was previously published in https://github.com/qczhang/icSHAPE (Nature, 2015, 486–490). RBRP pipeline calculates drug-promoted 2´-OH acylation in RBRP experiments.

Installation of RBRP pipeline involves two steps:

Step 1. Install and configure icSHAPE pipeline following the instructions on https://github.com/qczhang/icSHAPE

Step 2. Copy three scripts <normalizeRTfileScaleFactor1.pl>, <calcRBRPminusCtrl.pl>, and <filterRTstopBD.pl> to /icSHAPE/scripts/ to complete full installation.
